<h4>ESignature:</h4>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:5em">Electronic signatures aren’t exactly a novelty. They have been around since the American Civil War, during which contracts were signed through Morse. In a modern setting, an e-Sign refers to a unique, digitised, encrypted personal identifier. This is, in essence, different from the ‘wet’ signatures created by hand. The e-Sign is meant to complete transactions, loops, and agreements electronically.</p>

<p style="text-indent:5em">In India, the e-Sign has been granted legal status by amendments to various laws, namely the Information Technology Act, Indian Evidence Act and the Negotiable Instruments Act. Early adopters in the financial sector have started using e-Sign to get customers to sign loan and card applications, and loan agreements.</p>
